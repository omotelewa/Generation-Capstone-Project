        <p>The first thing I learned in my Culinary practical was to make cookies and ever since then I did not look back,
            I first started making cookies and baking for my family and friends during festivals and holiday season,
            then I started baking them more regularly as I thought I could do something more with this , some change in flavors
            texture and types. I started taking small orders for cookies during my college years and after getting good response 
            in my second year, I decided that I want to turn this into a something more meaningful and develop something 
            new , as I kept experimenting with my cookies and I came to realization that I can give people something 
            qualitative when it comes to cookies and thats where "House of cookies" was born. 
            I love making cookies and sharing them with people and see the joy on their face. 
            SO Who likes cookies? because We do. 
            Who else? Everybody. 
            What's even better? Delivery cookies. 
            Whouda thought? Well, we did. Turns out, people were pretty high on the idea.
            Founded in 2022, we deliver fresh-out-the-oven, melt-in-your-mouth cookies all day long, 
            and straight into the evening too, for all you midnight maniacs out there. 
            So pile up on your favorite flavor or mix-and-match. We can come to your place, or you can come to ours.
